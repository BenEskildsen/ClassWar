  - just can't raise prices without raising wages for working class
  - too many policies that punish working/middle when corps are doing poorly don't
    actually help the corporations
  - policies should be more likely based on wealth/wealthDelta of factions
    - policies that reduce benefits should be inverse weighted
  - landowners still suck up all the wealth
  - skill of middle class (universities!) just doesn't seem to matter
  - awkward when one policy is clearly necessary to survive but won't get recommended
  - upkeepCosts just erase money --> who are they paying?
  - what's stopping strategy of just always choosing policy to help poorest faction?
    - policies need more/nuanced changes
  - worker's wage must be more than (price * demand + rent)
    - how else can corporations make money to afford this pay?
  - policy to print money (but increase prices/rents)


- - - - - - BUGS - - - - - -
  - auto-playing ticks still hides indicators when policy pops up


- - - - - - UI - - - - - -
  - display Modal below ticker so you can always see it
  - have description as first line of hovercards?
  - also hovercard description of each faction on their name
  - rename Factions to Class?
  - View Policy button should hide it when clicked again
  - add government type to main info based on favorability
    (and wealth? or history of favorable policies)
  - get up and down arrows to look the same
  - better printing of faction props
  - better lay out of the policy UI and percents/dollars and buttons


- - - - - SIMULATION - - - - - -
  - history
    - total favorability across all turns
    - times sided with vs sided against
    - weighted by number of policies in config that they support?
  - favorability changes
    - consequences of unfavorability per faction
      - middle/working class -> strikes
      - corps -> raising prices
      - landowners -> raising rents
      - military ->
      - intelligentsia -> leave (reducing bonuses?)
    - bonuses for high favorability ?
      - poor -> ?
      - middle class -> greater skill
      - corps -> greater production


- - - - - - POLICIES - - - - - -
  - policy system
    - allow some policies to be picked multiple times and others to only be picked once
    - maybe have a hard-coded smaller set of policies to choose from at first
    - procedurally generate policies?


- - - - - POLISH/FLAVOR - - - - -
  - have factions at/near 0% favorability blink or something
  - need dicts for money/percents
    - in policy_change, in policy display, in game ui
    - specifically favorability
  - print out a few messages at the start with instructions
    - welcome dear leader ... hopefully you can last longer than the last one
    - but try to incorporate name of the game in there (Command Economy 2?)
  - ticker
    - months in power should be years + months (weeks?)
