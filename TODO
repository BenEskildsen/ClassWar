  - favorability changes
    - put in ticker for big changes (ie can't afford)
    - consequences of unfavorability per faction
      - poor -> strikes, then revolution
      - middle class -> strikes
      - corps -> reducing production, then leaving
    - bonuses for high favorability ?
      - poor -> ?
      - middle class -> greater skill
      - corps -> greater production
  - add in additional factions
  - construction:
    - productivity is just a wealth transfer to the government...
    - how to compute GDP
      - exports/imports? what is the point?
      - separate consumerism into demand + prices
        where prices are a function of production/gdp and demand
        is a function of consumerism + prices
    - unemployed could be a function of wages/wealth of corps
    - how does corp population fit in?

  - policy UI/implementation
  - many policies


- - - - - - UI - - - - - -
  - get better display (e.g. %'s) for faction-specific props
  - colored indicator arrow component based off of Plot
    - get up and down arrows to look the same
  - hovercard type things to show what contributes to a value?
