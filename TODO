  - more policies that are random big monetary handouts
  - strike-breaker policies that punish low-favorability
  - policies for increasing capital when it's low
  - if middle class demand > skill then inventory will never be enough


- - - - - - BUGS - - - - - -
  - make ticker auto-scroll with appending
  - auto-playing ticks still hides indicators when policy pops up
  - keep population/inventory/etc rounded
  - working class inventory deficits can be way less than demand?
  - one-time cash handouts need to check that the gov can afford
  - need dicts for money/percents
    - in policy_change, in policy display, in game ui
    - specifically favorability


- - - - - SIMULATION - - - - - -
  - favorability changes
    - consequences of unfavorability per faction
      - poor -> strikes, then revolution
      - middle class -> strikes
      - corps -> reducing production, then leaving
    - how to bounce back from 0% favorability ?
      - 0% favorable factions propose radical policies
        that they really want
    - bonuses for high favorability ?
      - poor -> ?
      - middle class -> greater skill
      - corps -> greater production
  - add in additional factions
    - landowners, intelligentsia, army
    - maybe they appear later?
      - start with landowners + working class?
  - construction:
    - how to compute GDP - exports/imports? what is the point?
    - how does corp population fit in?


- - - - - - POLICIES - - - - - -
  - policy system
    - allow some policies to be picked multiple times and others to only be picked once
    - make it so randomized change values are different every time that policy comes up
    - maybe have a hard-coded smaller set of policies to choose from at first
    - procedurally generate policies?
  - many policies (at least one per property)


- - - - - POLISH/FLAVOR - - - - -
  - print out a few messages at the start with instructions
    - welcome dear leader ... hopefully you can last longer than the last one
    - but try to incorporate name of the game in there
  - ticker
    - make ticker scrollable
    - months in power should be years + months (weeks?)


- - - - - - UI - - - - - -
  - add government type to main info based on favorability
    (and wealth? or history of favorable policies)
  - colored indicator arrow component based off of Plot
    - get up and down arrows to look the same
  - better printing of faction props
  - better lay out of the policy UI and percents/dollars and buttons
