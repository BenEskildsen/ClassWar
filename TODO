  - 10x all money values to give a little more leeway
  - add government type to main info based on favorability
  - how to lower unemployment once corps are making more money?
  - why can't corps afford to pay middle classes by just a bit when they definitely can?
  - favorability goes down when unemployment is high --> how to indicate this?


- - - - - SIMULATION - - - - - -
  - favorability changes
    - put in ticker for big changes (ie can't afford)
    - consequences of unfavorability per faction
      - poor -> strikes, then revolution
      - middle class -> strikes
      - corps -> reducing production, then leaving
    - bonuses for high favorability ?
      - poor -> ?
      - middle class -> greater skill
      - corps -> greater production
  - add in additional factions
    - landowners, intelligentsia, army
    - maybe they appear later?
      - start with landowners + working class
  - construction:
    - productivity is just a wealth transfer to the government...
    - how to compute GDP
      - exports/imports? what is the point?
      - separate consumerism into demand + prices
        where prices are a function of production/gdp and demand
        is a function of consumerism + prices
    - unemployed could be a function of wages/wealth of corps
    - how does corp population fit in?


- - - - - - POLICIES - - - - - -
  - policy system
    - allow some policies to be picked multiple times and others to only be picked once
    - make it so randomized change values are different every time that policy comes up
    - maybe have a hard-coded smaller set of policies to choose from at first
    - procedurally generate policies?
    - keep a history of all polices accepted and rejected
  - many policies
  - policy UI
    - better lay out of the policy and percents/dollars


- - - - - - UI - - - - - -
  - get better display (e.g. %'s) for faction-specific props
  - colored indicator arrow component based off of Plot
    - get up and down arrows to look the same
  - hovercard type things to show what contributes to a value?
